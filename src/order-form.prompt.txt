Hello, I need to make a React component to make Buy/Sell orders on a crypto Exchange.
The component should be styled with React + Typescript and tailwindcss classes.
It should have:
- it should be tabbed, it has a Buy/Sell choice on top
- a field to input the value of the order
- a field to input quantity
- a set of 4 buttons to set the quantity to 25% 50% 75% 100%
- a label knowing the user available balance in USD
- a readonly Input to show the size of the Order, expressed in USD
- A final button that  displays Buy or Sell depending on the tab

Please focus only on this component and not other details. Also please use hook-style components, not Class components
