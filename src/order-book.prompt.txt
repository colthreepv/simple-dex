Hello, I need to make a React component to display a crypto exchange Orderbook
The component should be styled with React + Typescript and tailwindcss classes.
Additional details:
- it should be a column component, expected to have a width of 400px
- it should show buy orders in the top part
- it should write the current market order price in-between the buy orders and the sell orders
- it should show the sell orders in the bottom part

The orders can have a data structure like this:

```
const orders = {
  buy: [
    { value: 12333, amount: 1000 },
    { value: 12400, amount: 5000 },
    { value: 12533, amount: 250 },
  ],
  current: 12300,
  sell: [
    { value: 12133, amount: 1000 },
    { value: 12200, amount: 1000 },
    { value: 12223, amount: 1000 },
  ]
}
```

Please focus only on this component and not other details. Also please use hook-style components, not Class components
